# Next release

* Bug fix: Fixed `swap` member function for all containers based on red-black tree.
  Now, `swap` member function also swaps the key comparison function `Compare`.
  Previously, `swap` member function did not swap the key comparison function.
* New unordered associative containers based on hash tables with separate chaining:
  * `unordered_map`
  * `unordered_set`
  * `unordered_multimap`
  * `unordered_multiset`
  * `small_unordered_map`
  * `small_unordered_set`
  * `small_unordered_multimap`
  * `small_unordered_multiset`
  * `static_unordered_map`
  * `static_unordered_set`
  * `static_unordered_multimap`
  * `static_unordered_multiset`
* Red-black tree: Reimplemented private member function `allocate_node` in
  terms of `allocator_traits::allocate`. Before this change, it was implemented
  in terms of `sfl::dtl::allocate` which always checks whether parameter `n` is
  zero. Parameter `n` is never zero, actually it is always one, so there is no
  need for using `sfl::dtl::allocate`.
* Red-black tree: Reimplemented private member function `deallocate_node` in
  terms os `allocator_traits::deallocate`. The explanation for this change is
  the same as the above explaination for reimplementation of `allocate_node`.
* Red-black tree: Improved `swap`.
* Red-black tree: Added `try_emplace`.
* Red-black tree: Added `insert_or_assign`.
* Map: Reimplemented `try_emplace` in terms of `rb_tree::try_emplace`.
* Map: Reimplemented `insert_or_assign` in terms of `rb_tree::insert_or_assign`.
* Small map: Reimplemented `try_emplace` in terms of `rb_tree::try_emplace`.
* Small map: Reimplemented `insert_or_assign` in terms of `rb_tree::insert_or_assign`.
* Static map: Reimplemented `try_emplace` in terms of `rb_tree::try_emplace`.
* Static map: Reimplemented `insert_or_assign` in terms of `rb_tree::insert_or_assign`.
* All containers based on red-black tree: Reimplemented all comparison operators
  in terms of comparison operators from `rb_tree`.
* Red-black tree: Reworked nested class `data`.
* Red-black tree: Removed copy assignment operator and added `assign_copy`.
* Red-black tree: Removed move assignment operator and added `assign_move`.
* Red-black tree: Refactored `swap`.
* Red-black tree: Removed non-member `swap`.



# 1.9.2 (2025-03-22)

* Bug fix: Fixed crash while erasing elements from red-black tree-based containers.
* Added `sfl.natvis` file for Visual Studio. Thanks to @ZehMatt.



# 1.9.1 (2025-01-29)

* Bug fix: Fixed support for allocators with fancy pointers in all containers
  based on red-black tree.

  Before this update, fancy pointers returned from `allocate()` were *converted*
  to native pointers and back from native to fancy pointers before passed to
  `deallocate()` which often resulted in metadata loss.

  Now, fancy pointers returned from `allocate()` are not *converted* to native
  pointers at all.




# 1.9.0 (2024-12-21)

* Bug fix in `segmented_devector::insert_range`: Auxiliary iterator was declared
  too early and was pointing to out-of-range, but it wasn't used. Now, iterator
  declaration is made in inner scope where it is actually used.
* New associative containers implemented as red-black tree:
  * `map`
  * `set`
  * `multimap`
  * `multiset`
  * `small_map`
  * `small_set`
  * `small_multimap`
  * `small_multiset`
  * `static_map`
  * `static_set`
  * `static_multimap`
  * `static_multiset`
* All containers: Added range constructor `container(sfl::from_range_t, Range&& r)`
  that is also available in C++11.
* All containers: Added range insertion function `insert_range(Range&& r)`
  that is also available in C++11.
* All vectors and devectors: Added range assignment function `assign_range(Range&& r)`
  that is also available in C++11.
* All vectors and devectors: Added range append function `append_range(Range&& r)`
  that is also available in C++11.
* All devectors: Added range prepend function `prepend_range(Range&& r)`
  that is also available in C++11.
* Refactored and removed `private.hpp`.
* GitHub actions: Use Ubuntu 24.04.
* GitHub actions: Use matrix strategies.



# 1.8.2 (2024-11-11)

* Bug fix: Use correct `__cplusplus` value for C++20 (it is `202002L`).



# 1.8.1 (2024-11-09)

* Fixed issue with MSVC compiler that does not correctly set `__cplusplus`
  unless compiler flag `/Zc:__cplusplus` is specified so `constexpr` and
  `nodiscard` were basically always disabled. Now, if MSVC compiler is used
  then library uses `_MSVC_LANG` instead of `__cplusplus`, that allows usage
  of newer C++ standard features without explicitly specifying `/Zc:__cplusplus`.
  Thanks to @ZehMatt.

* Added `iterator_concept` member type to `sfl::dtl::normal_iterator` in C++20
  that enables use of `std::ranges`. Thanks to @ZehMatt.

  For example, the following code will now successfuly compile in C++20:

      static_assert(std::random_access_iterator<sfl::small_vector<uint8_t, 16>::iterator>);
      static_assert(std::contiguous_iterator<sfl::small_vector<uint8_t, 16>::iterator>);
      static_assert(std::ranges::contiguous_range<sfl::small_vector<uint8_t, 16>>);
      static_assert(std::ranges::contiguous_range<sfl::vector<uint8_t>>);

* Fixed bug in `sfl::dtl::make_index_sequence`. Fortunately, this bug never
  caused a problem, but it had to be fixed to avoid problems in the future.



# 1.8.0 (2024-08-04)

* New containers `vector` and `devector` (double-ended vector).
* All small containers: Reworked private member function `recommend_size` and
  renamed it to `calculate_new_capacity`. Reduced grow factor from 2.0 to 1.5.



# 1.7.0 (2024-06-22)

* Iterators are now distinct types for all containers.
  Iterators are no more aliases for `pointer` and `const_pointer`.

  Now it is possible to overload functions for different iterators, for example:

      void test(const T*);
      void test(sfl::compact_vector<T>::const_iterator);
      void test(sfl::small_vector<T, 10>::const_iterator);
      void test(sfl::small_vector<T, 20>::const_iterator);
      void test(sfl::small_flat_set<T, 10>::const_iterator);
      void test(sfl::small_flat_set<T, 20>::const_iterator);
      void test(sfl::static_unordered_flat_set<T, 10>::const_iterator);
      void test(sfl::static_unordered_flat_set<T, 20>::const_iterator);

  The above example cannot be compiled with older versions of this library
  because iterators are just aliases to pointers and all overloads are
  equivalent to the overload for `const T*`.

# 1.3.1 (2024-03-20)

* Bug fix: If iterator is segmented iterator but not random access iterator then
  compiler must select the most basic algorithm (that is not specialized for
  segmented iterators).



# 1.3.0 (2024-03-16)

* New container `segmented_devector` (segmented double-ended vector).
* All containers: Added member function `available`.
* All containers: Moved common private functions into new header `private.hpp`.
* Implemented custom hierarchical algorithms `copy`, `move`, `fill`, etc. in

* Segmented vector: Improved tests for `resize`.
* Small vector: Renamed variables and exchanged first and second case in

* All containers: Use `sfl::dtl::enable_if_t` instead of `std::enable_if`
  for better readability.
* All containers: Use SFINAE instead of iterator tag dispatching to select the
  most appropriate private member functions `initialize_range`, `assign_range`,
  `insert_range` and similar.



# 1.2.4 (2024-02-13)

* Refactoring insert functions in small maps and sets. Removed duplicated code.
  Added private member function for checking `hint` iterator.
* Removed private nested class `temporary_value` from all containers.
  That class was actually was unnecessary. Just use `value_type` instead of.
* Reworked move assignment operator of `segmented_vector`. Old move assignment
  operator had unusual behavior: in some situations it behaved like `swap`.
* Reworked and improved all tests.
* Added GNU makefiles for test for GCC/Clang and Visual C++ compilers.
* Reworked scripts for testing on Arch Linux and CentOS 7.
* Added script for testing on Windows.
* Reworked and improved `erase(iterator)` and `erase(iterator, iterator)`
  member functions.
* Added GitHub actions for automated testing.
* Added CMake support. Thanks to @ZehMatt and @johannes-wolf.



# 1.2.3 (2023-08-14)

* Refactoring - inheritance. Containers no longer inherit directly from
  `Allocator`, `Compare` or `KeyEqual`. This solves some rare and obscure
  problems and errors (for example, `Allocator` with `virtual` member
  function that has the same name as container's member function).
  Every container from now has private member class `data` that contains
  pointers and inherits directly from `Allocator`, `Compare` or `KeyEqual`.
  Empty base optimization is also used in this case.



# 1.2.2 (2023-08-07)

* New test script. Added test scripts for CentOS 7 and Arch Linux to test all
  possible combinations of compiler flags.
* Converted detailed documentation from AsciiDoc to Markdown format. Markdown
  is simpler and easier to read and maintain.
* Updated README file.
* Converted CHANGELOG file to Markdown format.



# 1.2.1 (2023-02-23)

* Reorganized tests.
* Updated README file.



# 1.2.0 (2022-06-29)

* New container `segmented_vector`.
* Move constructors and move assignment operators no longer implicitly call
  `other.clear()`. This behavior applies to ALL containers.
  In other words, `other` is not guaranteed to be empty after the move.
  `other` is in a valid but unspecified state after the move.
* Bug fix: `small_vector` constructor taking only size is no longer `explicit`.
* Improved common functions and macros (`constexpr`, `noexcept`, all calls to
  functions in `SFL_DTL` namespace are fully qualified).
* Improved allocators for tests.



# 1.1.0 (2022-05-11)

* Added option to avoid exception handling. If `SFL_NO_EXCEPTIONS` is defined,
  the library avoids using try/catch/throw statements. In case of error
  `std::abort` is called.
* Internal changes: Removed macro `SFL_UNUSED`. Added function `ignore_unused`.
  Added macro `SFL_CONSTEXPR_14`.



# 1.0.1 (2022-03-24)

* Fixed compile error regarding function `to_pointer` when C++20 is used.
  Call to `to_address` must be fully qualified, i.e. `SFL_DTL::to_address`.
  If call is not fully qualified then compiler somehow cannot decide between
  `std::to_address` and `SFL_DTL::to_address`.
* Improved tests. Testing with different allocators. Several allocators are
  designed specially for tests. One of allocators uses fancy pointers.



# 1.0.0 (2022-03-17)

* Fancy pointers revisited. Using pointer traits `to_address` and `to_pointer`.
* Started semantic versioning (see https://semver.org).
* Added file VERSION.txt.



# 2022-03-13-1

* `static_assert` must have message in C++11.



# 2022-03-13

* Added pointer trait `to_address`. Added support for fancy pointers.
* Updating tests.
* Added file CHANGELOG.txt.



# 2022-02-24

* Fixed `swap` member functions. Old member functions could create memory leaks
  in case of exceptions.
